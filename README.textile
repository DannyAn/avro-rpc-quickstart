h1. Avro RPC Quick Start

"http://hadoop.apache.org/avro/":http://hadoop.apache.org/avro/

h2. Summary

This is a template/blueprint project intended as a Quick Start introduction to Avro. You'll learn how to define a protocol, generate and compile your code, and run a working "Hello World" type example.

h2. Requirements

Other than maven you will need the Avro Maven Plugin to compile the protocol specification. I've included the Avro Maven plugin jar file in this repository for simplicity and to get you started quickly. However you can examine the source here: "avro-maven-plugin":http://github.com/phunt/avro-maven-plugin
